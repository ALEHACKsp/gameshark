The reason for this self-leak is it was released on yougame.biz while broken. I've decided, despite the owner trying to cover it up, to release it myself since the whole cheat was my own idea (menu framework, features, etc..)
ov, if you're reading this, sorry. The source was already released and I checked it out. I removed jumpbug, edgebug and those kinds of movement features since they're already public.

Good luck, have fun.
